# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement real-time icon search with debouncing





  - Add debounce timeout variable and constant for 300ms delay
  - Create `handleIconSearchInput()` function that clears previous timeout and sets new one
  - Add input event listener to icon search field
  - Modify `searchIcons()` to work without button click requirement
  - Add logic to clear results when input is empty
  - Ensure minimum 1 character before triggering search
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 2. Fix icon selection persistence issue





  - Review and debug the `selectIcon()` function to identify why icons don't save properly
  - Verify hidden input fields (`selected-icon-id`, `selected-icon-url`) are correctly populated
  - Ensure `selectedIcon` object is maintained throughout form lifecycle
  - Add defensive checks in `handleLinkFormSubmit()` to verify icon data before submission
  - Test icon selection during both create and edit flows
  - Verify icon data persists when switching between visual types
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 3. Implement clean URL routing
- [ ] 3.1 Add route handlers for clean URLs
  - Add GET route for `/admin` that serves `admin.html`
  - Add GET route for `/login` that serves `login.html`
  - Add GET route for `/index` that serves `index.html`
  - Add GET route for `/` that serves `index.html`
  - Position routes after API routes but before static file serving
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 3.2 Add redirect routes for backward compatibility
  - Add GET route for `/*.html` that redirects to clean URL (301 permanent redirect)
  - Ensure redirect route is positioned after clean URL routes
  - Test that `/admin.html` redirects to `/admin`
  - Test that `/login.html` redirects to `/login`
  - _Requirements: 3.4_

- [ ] 3.3 Update internal links in HTML files
  - Update links in `admin.html` to use clean URLs
  - Update links in `login.html` to use clean URLs
  - Update links in `index.html` to use clean URLs
  - Update redirect URLs in JavaScript files (`admin.js`, etc.) to use clean URLs
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 3.4 Add 404 error handling
  - Implement catch-all route for non-existent pages
  - Return appropriate 404 status and error page
  - _Requirements: 3.5_
