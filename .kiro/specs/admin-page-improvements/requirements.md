# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the admin page functionality in the link sharing application. The improvements focus on enhancing the user experience for icon search, fixing icon selection persistence, and implementing clean URL routing for all pages.

## Glossary

- **Admin Page**: The administrative interface where users manage their links and profile settings
- **Icon Search**: The feature that allows users to search and select icons for their links
- **Search Results Box**: The UI component that displays matching icons based on search input
- **Debouncing**: A technique that delays execution until after a specified time has passed since the last invocation
- **Clean URL Routing**: URL patterns without file extensions (e.g., /admin instead of /admin.html)
- **Link Icon**: The visual icon associated with a user's link entry
- **Server**: The Express.js backend application

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the icon search results to appear automatically as I type, so that I can quickly find and select icons without clicking a search button.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin user types in the icon search input field, THE Server SHALL display the search results box after a 300 millisecond delay from the last keystroke
2. WHILE the admin user continues typing, THE Server SHALL cancel any pending search operations and restart the delay timer
3. THE Admin Page SHALL display matching icon results in the search results box without requiring a button click
4. WHEN the search input field is empty, THE Admin Page SHALL hide the search results box
5. THE Admin Page SHALL display a minimum of 1 character before triggering the automatic search

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want my selected icon to save correctly to my link, so that the icon I choose is properly associated with the link.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin user clicks on an icon from the search results, THE Admin Page SHALL store the selected icon identifier with the corresponding link
2. WHEN the admin user saves the link, THE Server SHALL persist the icon selection to the data storage
3. WHEN the admin user reloads the admin page, THE Admin Page SHALL display the previously saved icon for each link
4. IF an icon selection fails to save, THEN THE Admin Page SHALL display an error message to the user
5. THE Admin Page SHALL update the link preview with the selected icon immediately upon selection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access pages using clean URLs without file extensions, so that the application feels more professional and user-friendly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to "/admin", THE Server SHALL serve the admin page content
2. WHEN a user navigates to "/login", THE Server SHALL serve the login page content
3. WHEN a user navigates to "/" or "/index", THE Server SHALL serve the main index page content
4. THE Server SHALL maintain backward compatibility by redirecting requests with .html extensions to clean URLs
5. THE Server SHALL return a 404 error for non-existent routes
